Problem1:

Try not to split each partial exercise into a separate file :)

C,d,f: 	DtDt(u, t): is wrongly defined. Shuld use discrete version here. 



Problem 21:

a) Program stops due to "Invalid syntax". We tried to fix some errors, but code is not finished.

b) test_equi.. is never run, so program doesnt do anything. Nosetest fails due to simulate() isnt defined or imported. However, the code could work if run and simulate() were available :)

c) Same problems as in c). Code not finished

Conclusion:
Much of the code looks correct, but its simply not finished.
